\section{Combinatorial estimates by the switching method}

M. Hasheminezhad and B. D. McKay, Combinatorial estimates by the switching
method, Contemporary Mathematics, 531 (2010) 209-221.


\subsection{Summary}

Consider a finite set $\Omega$ of objects. A switching is a (nondeterministic)
operation that transforms one object into another (or more generally,
a switching is a relation $R\subseteq\Omega\times\Omega$). We can
partition $\Omega$ into subsets $\left\{ C\left(v\right)\right\} _{v\in V}$
and put a directed graph structure (possibly with loops) on the index
set $V$: if an element in $C\left(v\right)$ can switch to an element
in $C\left(w\right)$ then there is an arc between $v$ and $w$.

Hopefully, for each $v$ we can find a good lower bound $a\left(v\right)$
on the number of ways an $\omega\in C\left(v\right)$ can be switched,
and a good upper bound $b\left(v\right)$ on the number of switchings
an $\omega\in C\left(v\right)$ can be produced by. If we imagine
that all switchings are performed at once, $a$ and $b$ give bounds
on the inflow and outflow at each vertex in terms of the size of each
$C\left(v\right)$. (So, $a\left(v\right)$ and $b\left(v\right)$
can more generally be bounds on the \textit{average} number of switchings
per element in $C\left(v\right)$).

This gives some information about the relative sizes of the classes
$C\left(v\right)$. Given a set of vertices $X$, let $N\left(X\right)$
be the total amount of elements in all $C\left(x\right)$, where $x\in X$.
The objective of the paper is to bound $N\left(Y\right)/N\left(X\right)$
for given vertex sets $X$ and $Y$.

In order to obtain bounds on $N\left(Y\right)/N\left(X\right)$, we
write the constraints as a system of linear inequalities. Let $s'\left(v,w\right)$
be the (unknown) amount of switchings going from $C\left(v\right)$
to $C\left(w\right)$. For instance, for any vertex $v$, we have
$\sum s'\left(vw\right)\ge a\left(v\right)N\left(v\right)$. A nonzero
assignment of $s$ and $N$ satisfying the full set of inequalities
is called a \textit{feasible solution}, and a feasible solution which
maximizes $N\left(Y\right)/N\left(X\right)$ is called an \textit{optimal
solution}.

The key result of the paper is to show that optimal solutions always
take one of six standard forms. This is proved by a reduction of the
inequalities to a linear program, and the fact that an optimal solution
of a linear program always occurs at a vertex of the corresponding
convex polytope. The analysis is amenable to a general bound $\alpha$
on the arcs of the digraph instead of the functions $a,b$ (in that
case we have $\alpha\left(v,w\right)=b\left(w\right)/a\left(v\right)$).
Although$\alpha$ doesn't have a clear combinatorial interpretation,
the paper suggests that different $\alpha$ may arise from richer
information bounding the behaviour of the flow of switchings.

For a number of commonly-satisfied assumptions, the paper proves some
alternative bounds for $N\left(Y\right)/N\left(X\right)$ that are
slightly looser but easier to apply. In particular, a common use case
is that we have some statistic on the objects in $\Omega$ and we
believe that objects with a high value of that statistic make up a
negligible fraction of all the objects in $\Omega$. We would then
partition the objects according to our statistic, and design a switching
that tends to decrease the statistic, but by no more than some fixed
amount. We would choose $X$ to be the set of all vertices (partititions)
and $Y$ would be the set of all vertices (partitions) with a statistic
value higher than some $M$.


\subsection{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item I'm not sure why $i_{k-1}=\max\left\{ M-\left(k-1\right)K,N+1\right\} $
is required for cases (a) and (b) of Lemma 3, instead of just $M-\left(k-1\right)K$
as in case (c).
\item In Corollary 1, it isn't spelled out what assumptions $X$ should
satisfy, but it would seem A1 still has to hold.
\item In Corollary 1, the somewhat inscrutable expression $k=\ceil{\frac{M+\min\left\{ 0,K-\rho-1\right\} }{K}}$
can be more easily seen to be $k=\ceil{\frac{M-\floor{\rho}}{K}}$.

\section{Asymptotic enumeration of sparse multigraphs with given degrees}

C. Greenhill and B. D. McKay, Asymptotic enumeration of sparse multigraphs
with given degrees, arXiv preprint arXiv:1303.4218 (2013)

(unfinished)


\subsection{Summary}

The paper introduces a generalized version of the switching method,
where there are multiple different ``colours'' of switchings that
operate on the same set of objects. By slightly loosening the bound,
this generalized model can be reduced to an instance of the single-switching
model.


\subsection{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item The switchings are described in terms of \textit{oriented} edges.
That makes sense because $M$ is the sum of the degrees and therefore
twice the number of edges.
\item When giving a lower bound for the number of switchings, there are
formulas like $\left[\ell_{1}\right]_{3}-O\left(k_{\mathrm{max}}\ell_{1}^{2}\right)$.
The reasoning for the $O\left(k_{\mathrm{max}}\ell_{1}^{2}\right)$
term is that it bounds the number of triples where two vertices are
loops and the second of those is adjacent to the final vertex. This
is an upper bound for the number of triples of loops which contain
an edge.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Remarks}


\subsubsection{Proposition 1.15}

The ``subsubsequence principle'' means that taking $n$ along any
subsequence of $\NN$, we can find a subsubsequence so that either
$M$ is bounded, or $N-M$ is bounded, or $M\left(N-M\right)/N\to\infty$.
For, suppose none of these are true. Take a subsubsequence where $M/N$
and $\left(N-M\right)/N$ both converge. They cannot both converge
to zero; if for example $M/N\to L>0$ then $M\left(N-M\right)/N=\Theta\left(N-M\right)$,
contradiction.

In fact we can assume that if $M\left(N-M\right)/N\not\to\infty$
then $M$ or $N-M$ is constant, which simplifies the analysis significantly.
If $M$ is constant, prove that $\Pr\left(\left|\Gamma_{M/N}\right|<M\right)\to p_{M}\left(M\right)/e^{M}$,
where $p_{M}$ is the first $M$ terms of the taylor expansion of
$e^{z}$. Also, I think the result of the central limit theorem is
not enough for the estimate $\Pr\left(\left|\Gamma_{M/N}\right|<M\right)\to1/2$,
one needs to dig into the proof by convergence of characteristic function.


\subsubsection{Theorem 5.4}

The process can be viewed as either exploring a random graph or randomly
generating a graph in an exotic edge order. Both are equivalent, but
different viewpoints help understand different parts of the argument.
The ``$k$th step'' means the $k$th saturation, not the $k$th
generation. If the process is dead before step $k$, then $X_{k}$
is not defined. The last paragraph on p109/first paragraph on p110
is confusing and contains some typos, here's a little reprashing of
bits and pieces:

The event that after the first $k$ steps (saturations) there are
fewer than $\left(c-1\right)k/2$ unsaturated vertices remaining and
the process is alive is 
\[
H=\left\{ \mbox{process is alive for step \ensuremath{k}and}\sum_{i=1}^{k}X_{i}-k<\frac{\left(c-1\right)k}{2}\right\} .
\]
Now, at step $i$, if $m$ vertices have been touched there are $n-m$
vertices that can be touched, each with probability $p$, so $X_{i}\sim\mathrm{Bi}\left(n-m,p\right)$.
For event $H$, no more than $\left(c+1\right)k_{+}/2$ vertices can
have been touched up to step $k$, so $X_{i}\ge X_{i}^{-}$ where
$X_{i}^{-}\sim\mathrm{Bi}\left(n-k_{+}\left(c+1\right)/2,p\right)$.
Then $\sum_{i=1}^{k}X_{i}^{-}\sim\mathrm{Bi}\left(k\left(n-n^{2/3}\left(c+1\right)\right)/2,p\right)$
and $\E\left[\sum_{i=1}^{k}X_{i}^{-}\right]>k-1$ for sufficiently
large $n$.

The bound for there to be two giant components uses $e^{Q}\ge1+Q$
for $Q=-c/n$. I think formal justification for the for the $o\left(1\right)$
term in $\rho_{-}+o\left(1\right)$ is quite complicated. Let $Y_{n}\sim\mathrm{Bi}\left(n,c/n\right)$
and $Y\sim\mathrm{Po}\left(c\right)$. Since $Y_{n}\xrightarrow{d}Y$,
for all $\varepsilon$ there is $N$ so that $Y_{n}\le\left(1+\varepsilon\right)Y$
for $n>N$. The pgf of $Y$ is $G:x\mapsto\exp\left(c\left(x^{1+\varepsilon}-1\right)\right)$
so by the implicit function theorem, the solution for $x$ of $G\left(x;\varepsilon\right)=x$
is continuous in $\varepsilon$ and 
\begin{align*}
 & \Pr\left(\mbox{branching process with }X_{i}\sim\mathrm{Bi}\left(n,c/n\right)\mbox{ dies after more than }k_{-}\mbox{ steps}\right)\\
 & \le\Pr\left(\mbox{branching process with }X_{i}\sim\mathrm{Po}\left(c\right)\mbox{ dies after more than }k_{-}\mbox{ steps}\right)+o\left(1\right)
\end{align*}
because $\Pr\left(\mbox{process dies at all}\right)$ is (in the limit)
the same for both cases. But since $k_{-}\to\infty$ the above probability
is $o\left(1\right)$.

To choose an ordered pair of small vertices, first choose a small
vertex arbitrarily (there are $n\rho\left(n,p\right)$ ways to do
this on average), then either choose a small vertex in the same component
(there are at most $k_{-}-1$ ways to do this), or choose a small
vertex in a different component (there are independently $n\rho\left(n-O\left(k_{-}\right),p\right)$
ways of doing this on average). Using a similar bounding argument
as for $\rho\left(n,p\right)$ we have $\rho\left(n-O\left(k_{-}\right),p\right)\sim\rho\left(n,p\right)$.
